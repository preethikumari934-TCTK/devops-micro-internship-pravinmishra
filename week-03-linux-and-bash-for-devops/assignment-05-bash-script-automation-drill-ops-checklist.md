# Assignment 5 — Bash Script Automation Drill (OPS Checklist)

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will practice Bash scripting by building a series of small automation scripts covering environment setup, variables, arrays, loops, file conditionals, if-else logic, and functions. These scripts form the foundation of real-world Linux automation used in DevOps, cloud, and production support environments.

# Task 1 — Bash Environment & Workspace Setup

## Goal

Verify that Bash is available on your system and create a clean workspace for this assignment.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Output of `echo $SHELL` and `bash --version`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 2 — Output of `pwd` and `ls -lah` showing the scripts directory

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Notes

Answer the following in your own words:

**1. What is Bash?**

Bash (short for Bourne-Again SHell) is a command-line interface and scripting language used to interact with operating systems. It is the default shell for most Linux distributions and older versions of macOS, and it can be run on Windows via tools like WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
Essentially, Bash acts as a translator between you and the computer, allowing you to control the system by typing commands instead of clicking icons.

---

**2. What is the difference between shell and Bash?**

The core difference is that a shell is a generic category, while Bash is a specific product within that category.
Think of it like this: "Shell" is the operating system's car, and "Bash" is a specific brand of car (like a Toyota Camry).


---

**3. Why is it important to confirm the Bash version before writing scripts?**

Confirming your Bash version before writing scripts is critical because features, syntax, and behaviors vary significantly between older and newer versions. If a script relies on a feature introduced in a recent update, it will crash or behave unpredictably when executed on a system running an older version.


---

# Task 2 — Your First Bash Script

## Goal

Create your first Bash script, make it executable, and run it from the terminal.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Content of `first-script.sh`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 2 — Output of `./first-script.sh`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 3 — Output of `ls -l first-script.sh` showing executable permission

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Notes

Answer the following in your own words:

**1. What is the purpose of `#!/bin/bash`?**

The line #!/bin/bash (pronounced "shebang") is the very first line of a script, and its purpose is to tell the operating system exactly which interpreter to use to execute the code below it.
Without this line, the system will guess which shell to use, which often leads to errors if the script contains Bash-specific code.

---

**2. Why do we use `chmod +x` before running a script?**

We use chmod +x because security protocols in Linux, macOS, and Unix-like operating systems block newly created files from running as programs by default. The chmod +x command explicitly grants execution permissions to the file.
Without this step, the system treats your script as a plain text file, and trying to run it directly will result in a "Permission denied" error.

---

**3. What is the difference between running a script using `./script.sh` and `bash script.sh`?**

The difference between the two commands comes down to how the system finds the interpreter and whether the script needs execution permissions.

---

# Task 3 — Variables: User Information Script

## Goal

Use variables to store and display user-related information.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Content of `user-info.sh`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 2 — Output of `./user-info.sh`

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Notes

Answer the following in your own words:

**1. What is a variable in Bash?**

A variable in Bash is a temporary storage location that holds a piece of text or data in memory. You assign it a name, and you can reference that name later in your script or terminal to retrieve or manipulate the stored value.
In Bash, all variables are treated natively as strings (text), though they can be treated as integers under specific conditions.

---

**2. Why should we avoid spaces around the `=` sign when creating variables?**

In Bash, you must avoid spaces around the = sign because Bash interprets spaces as command separators.
If you include spaces, Bash will mistake your variable name for an independent terminal command and the rest of the line for arguments.

---

**3. How do you access the value stored inside a Bash variable?**

To access the value stored inside a Bash variable, you prefix the variable's name with a dollar sign ($).

---

# Task 4 — Arrays & Loops: Tools Checklist Script

## Goal

Use arrays and loops to print a checklist of tools used in Bash scripting.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Content of `tools-checklist.sh`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 2 — Output of `./tools-checklist.sh`

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Notes

Answer the following in your own words:

**1. What is an array in Bash?**

An array in Bash is a variable that can hold multiple values under a single name. Instead of creating separate variables like user1, user2, and user3, you can store all of them inside a single array variable.
Bash supports two types of arrays:
• Indexed Arrays: Values are assigned to a numbered list starting at index 0.
• Associative Arrays: Values are assigned to custom text keys instead of numbers (requires Bash 4.0+).

---

**2. Why are arrays useful in scripts?**

 Arrays are useful in scripts because they allow you to manage groups of related data efficiently without writing repetitive code. Instead of creating and managing dozens of individual variables, you can handle them as a single entity.


---

**3. What does `"${tools[@]}"` mean?**

The syntax "${tools[@]}" is used to expand a Bash array to retrieve all of its items safely and individually.

---

**4. What is the purpose of the `for` loop in this script?**

The purpose of a for loop is to repeat a specific block of commands multiple times, iterating through a list of items one by one. Instead of writing the same code over and over for different inputs, the loop automates the process by substituting a new value into a variable during each turn (iteration).


---

# Task 5 — Loops: Number Counter Script

## Goal

Use loops to repeat a task multiple times.

### Evidence

Add your screenshot here.

---
